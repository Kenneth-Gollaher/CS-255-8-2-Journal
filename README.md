CS-255-System Analysis and Design

# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

As a member of a small consulting company, we have been assigned to develop new software for our client DriverPass. DriverPass would like us to develop an online educational web application to increase test results for students taking the DMV written and driving tests. There has been a decrease in students passing these tests and our client would like to give students a better opportunity to learn and increase their skills prior to taking the DMV required tests.

# What did you do particularly well?

In this particular assignment as systems analyst, I was able to provide the client with detailed diagrams and reports. These documents helped the client fully understand the system and give them a big picture of the completed system. The diagrams used to represent the system were through UML activity diagrams, use case diagrams, sequence diagrams, and class diagrams.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

One of the documents that I could revise and improve on is the UML use case diagram. This diagram can get fairly cluttered as there can be many use cases within an application. In this particular assignment, I could have made the diagram basic, but found there are many steps to each use case. To improve this diagram, I would make the diagram larger and possibly the use case descriptions shorter so that I can include more extensions and include lines. This document necessarily isn't an easy read for a client, but more for a development tool for the developement and analytical team.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?



# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
